Although the second "birthday" of the 1MB Club is officially *November 19*, I couldn't help by write down some of my thoughts about this project over the past two years. I honestly have nothing but positive things to say and the amount of interest in this silly side project has been wonderful!

## Some Fun Stats

Let's take a look at some stats that don't mean anything of *real* importance (please note - these figures are based on stats collected at the time of writing):

The **Github** repo has the following:

- 290 stars
- 197 forks
- 391 commits
- 246 contributors
- 351 pull requests (all closed!)

Some fun facts about the **website** itself:

- 742 total members
- Total size of all member websites combined: **169.4 MB**
- Average member website size: **228.3 KB**
- 8 [Hall of Fame](/#hof) members (thank you!)
- 3 website redesigns since launch ([read more](/blog/club-updates/))
- Switched hosting from Netlify to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET
- Recently added a web-focused [blog](/blog)

## Closing Thoughts

I'm still passionate about making a leaner, more performance-based web. I still get excited seeing another member request pop into my inbox. I love getting to visit those submitted websites and discovering something *new* on the internet. Something I otherwise would have probably missed. It's a good reminder how truly massive the size of the internet is.

I should also mention that the members who have requested to join have been nothing but nice. It's been great interacting with so many others who share the same passion for a "smaller" web footprint. My hope is to keep this collection growing for as long as I possibly can.

Thanks for reading,
