summary: "I finally got around to testing and purging 1MB Club member websites"
---

This project has been running for almost 3 years now, and I still enjoy adding more members to the club! The only issue is that I have never been great at ensuring the quality of the members remained consistent. This included removing dead links, sites that now forward to less-than-safe domains, etc. 

That all changes today!

## The First Purge

I wrote up a very crude script that checks the status of each existing club member's URL and flags those that error-out. After running the check I found I could remove over 60 websites that were either dead or broken.

> **Note:** If you happen to notice your website has been incorrectly caught in the "purge-crossfire", then don't hesitate to shoot me an email letting me know! I'm only human after all.

## Checking URL Script

This `ruby` script is far from perfect but it works well for my own personal workflow. Feel free to steal this and tweak it for your own purposes as you see fit!

```
require 'httparty'
require 'nokogiri'

HTTParty::Basement.default_options.update(verify: false)

response = HTTParty.get('https://1mb.club')

document = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body)
website_urls = document.css("#container tr")

puts "Scanning website members URLs..."
website_urls.each do |single_site|
    begin
        url = single_site.css("a.site").first.attribute("href").value
        response = HTTParty.get(url, timeout: 4)
        puts "Checking: " + url
    rescue Exception
        puts "<!-------- ERROR: " + url
    end
end
```

I have been slacking in terms of web-related content on this blog. My plan is to improve that and I even have a few outlines ready to go. I'll be sure to keep you all posted when something new is published!
