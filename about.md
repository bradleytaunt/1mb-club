## About 1MB Club

The internet has become a <em>bloated mess</em>. Massive JavaScript libraries. Countless client-side queries. Overly complex frontend frameworks.

But we can make a difference - no matter how small it may seem. <em>1MB Club</em> is a growing collection of performance-focused web pages found across the internet. All member websites weigh less than 1 megabyte in page size.

    <p>Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.</p>
