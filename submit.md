## Review & Accepting Submissions

**All web pages submitted will be manually reviewed for honesty and quality assurance.**

1MB Club has the final say whether a web page is added to the official listing or not. Spam, low-quality pages, or shady SEO gimmicks will be ignored. If your web page is not accepted, please do not take it personally. Let's refrain from being rude to each other!

**The two rules for a web page to qualify as a member:**

<ol>
    <li>Total web page size (not <i>just</i> transferred data) must not exceed 1 megabyte</li>
    <li>The web page must contain a reasonable amount of content / usefulness in order to be added - no sites with a simple line of text, etc.</li>
</ol>

## How to Submit

> Note: All web pages are manually tested through Firefox's network monitor for consistency. The **total** web page will be taken into account, not just the "transferred".

### Pull Requests

[Submit a pull request](https://git.disroot.org/bt/1mb-club/pulls) and your web page will be reviewed for quality assurance.

The format of your newly added web page should be as follows:

- Name the file as `yourdomain.com.md` (make note of the Markdown extension!)
- The inner content should be set like the format below (page size set to a **single decimal place**):

```
---
pageurl: yourdomain.com
size: 8.2

```
