#### Yearly Operational Costs

FYI: the overall cost to maintain this website (along with all my other [projects](https://btxx.org/projects) on a single VM) is $40/year for hosting. That means just **$40 a year in contributions** would let this project continue to operate *indefinitely*.

## What You Get in Return

You get your website posted inside the main "Hall of Fame" section found on both the homepage of this site and the bottom of every blog post.

Nothing crazy but it's the least I can do to say thank you!
